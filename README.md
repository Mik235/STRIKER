# SourceRender

SourceRender is a Discord bot that can record your CS:GO highlights simply by giving it a matchmaking sharecode.

It is currently a work in process and is not being run in production.

## Acknowledgements

The structure of the application was heavily inspired by the book [Architecture Patterns with Python](https://www.cosmicpython.com/).

For recording demos, [HLAE/advancedfx](https://github.com/advancedfx/advancedfx) is used.

For parsing demos, [demofile](https://github.com/saul/demofile) is used.
